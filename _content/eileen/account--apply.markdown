Your library card connects you to a wealth of resources, learning, and enrichment. You can register for cards at our West Checkout Desk on the first floor. If you have any questions about library cards or your account, email [link] Customer Services or call 847-673-7774.

##How do I get a card?

##Skokie residents
Bring a photo I.D. with your name and current Skokie address to the West Checkout Desk to apply for a library card. Residents under the age of 16 need a parent's signature. Young children need to be able to print their first and last name on their card. You may also start the process online [link] and later pick up your card in person (don't forget to bring I.D.).

##Suburban residents
If you don't live in Skokie but have a library card from RAILS member public library [link to RAILS], bring your card and photo I.D. with name and current address to register your card at Skokie. Nonresidents can check out most items, borrowing limits will apply. Customers outside of the RAILS system may purchase a Skokie Public Library card for the cost of taxpayer support.
##Skokie Businesses
Companies based in Skokie or those with a current membership in the Skokie Chamber of Commerce may apply for a business library card. Complete the business library card application form and return to Skokie Public Library with the required documentation. Cards will be mailed to the business address.[business card application form]()
##Lost Library Cards
Call immediately to report a lost or stolen card. You are responsible for any items checked out with the card until you notify the library. Replacement cards cost $1.00.
