##Upcoming Exhibit

###Art Quilts of the Black Threads Collective

January 10-February 26, 2015

“To look at a quilt is to see history,” says Tracy Vaughn-Manley, founder of the Black Threads Collective. She believes that these quilts “represent the resilience of Americans in general and of African American women in particular.”

###Suggest an Exhibit

We display art of various media and cultures. Many more requests are made than can be accommodated; therefore, artists should not expect that applications to exhibit will be accepted. All works must be framed and wired for hanging. In order to be considered, interested parties must submit an email to the Communications and Marketing Manager that includes the following information:

- Description of work
- Sizes of works/frames and number of items
- References/other shows in which the artist has exhibited
- A link to at least 10 photographs of the work (no attachments to emails, please)
- Artist's contact information, including email and phone number

Please direct inquiries to [Communications and Marketing Manager](crobinson@skokielibrary.info).
