##Using your account 

[Log in](https://catalog.skokielibrary.info/iii/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fencore.skokielibrary.info%3A443%2Fiii%2Fencore%2Fj_acegi_cas_security_check&lang=eng) to your account to see checkouts, due dates, fines, renewals, and reserves.

###Renewals
You can renew most items if no one else is on the waiting list or if items haven't reached their renewal limit. Call 847-673-2675 to use our automated renewal line or log in to renew online.

###Reserves and pickup
You can have up to 15 items on reserve at any one time. Place reserves through our catalog, in person, or by phone. If you don't see something you want, request it [link to request page]. 

Pick up reserved items at the library or elect to have them placed on the Bookmobile [link to page] or delivered to your door via USPS with Library Express (mailing cost is $2 per item).

###Due date notification
We can email due date, overdue, and reserve notifications. Give us your email address when you get your library card or add an email to your account (log in and select "Edit account").

###Paying fines 
Fines may be paid with cash or check at the east or west checkout desks or at any of the self-checkout machines with a debit or credit card. Fines may also be paid online with a debit or credit card by signing into your account.

###Change of address
If you move, update your address and phone number at the West Checkout Desk.
