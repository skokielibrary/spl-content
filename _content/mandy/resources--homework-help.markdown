##Homework Help Resources

###Live Homework Help

Skokie Public Library subscribes to [Live Homework Help](http://lhh.tutor.com/?ProgramGUID=4e339970-4f83-46c7-8373-65e0218340a3), an online tutoring service that connects students in kindergarten through 12th grade (as well as college and adult learners) with expert tutors--certified teachers, university professors, graduate school students, college students, and professionals who are experts in their fields.

Live Homework Help is open from 3-10 pm, seven days a week. All tutoring sessions are guided by the tutor and last approximately 20 minutes. The SkillsCenter Resource Library of worksheets, tutorials, and study guides is available 24/7. *There is a limit of five sessions per week per Skokie cardholder.* [Check with Bruce if this is up-to-date.]

Visit the Live Homework Help Learning Suite and, when you're ready, follow the steps to connect with a tutor. If you have trouble connecting to Live Homework Help or the Online Classroom, visit Tutor.com's [Live Homework Help Support FAQ](http://lhh.tutor.com/policies/faq.aspx) or chat with a [Live Homework Help support representative](http://lhh.tutor.com/policies/live-support.htm).

###Skokie Schools

Skokie is home to many public and private schools. [SkokieNet's Directory of K-12 Schools](http://skokienet.org/taxonomy/term/1619) features a complete list of school websites and contact information.

A number of Skokie schools have loaned us copies of their textbooks for use in the library. So check with us the next time a school book is left behind. We just may have it!
