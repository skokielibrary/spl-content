The Library has Book Discussion Kits available for use by local book groups.

-  The kits are checked out for six weeks.
- Each kit contains twelve copies of each title, discussion questions, and a bag to carry it all in. 
- One book group member will check out a kit at the Readers’ Services Desk.  This member is responsible for returning the complete kits back to the Readers’ Services Desk by the due date.
- Single copies of the books in the kit cannot be checked out.
- There is a daily late fee of $.25 a day for a kit returned after the due date, and fines will also be charged for lost or damaged materials. 
- If your book group is interested in borrowing any of the titles for your discussion, please contact the Readers' Services Desk at 847.673.7774 by phone, or via email at askrs@skokielibrary.info.
