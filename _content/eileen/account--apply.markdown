Your library card connects you to a world of resources and learning. Register for a card at our West Checkout Desk on the first floor. 

If you have questions about library cards or your account, email [link] Customer Services or call 847-673-7774.

##Getting a card

###Skokie residents
Bring a photo I.D. with your name and current Skokie address to the West Checkout Desk to apply. Residents under the age of 16 need a parent's signature; young children need to be able to print their first and last name to get their own card. 

You also can start the process online [link] and pick up your card in person later (don't forget to bring along I.D.).

###Suburban residents
If you don't live in Skokie but have a library card from a [RAILS public library](http://www.librarylearning.info/libraries/?LibSys=RAILS&LibraryTypeID=1), bring your card and photo I.D. with name and current address to register your card. Nonresidents can check out most of our items, but some borrowing limits [link] do apply. 

If you live in Chicago or elsewhere outside the RAILS system, you can buy a Skokie Public Library card for the cost of taxpayer support.

###Skokie businesses
Companies based in Skokie or members of the Skokie Chamber of Commerce are eligible for a business library card. Complete the business library card application [link] and return it to us with the required documentation. [need to find out what this is]. We'll mail the card to the business address.

##Lost your card?
Call immediately to report a lost or stolen card, as you're responsible for any items checked out with the card until we're notified. Replacement cards cost $1.
