Our Youth Services Department features books, music, and movies for babies through 8th graders, but that's not all we have to offer. Our circulating collection also includes audiobooks, video games, puppets, Playaway Views, Little Learner backpacks, and STEAM kits.

## Visiting Youth Services

While you're here, be sure to check out all the kid-friendly areas within the department.
- *Program Room.* This is "the place" for many of our storytimes and other programs. We also schedule programs throughout the department, with bigger performances and events happening in the Petty Auditorium or Mary Radmacher Meeting Room. For full details about all of our youth and family programs, visit our [Events](http://skokielibrary.info/s_programs/index.asp) page. 
- *Craft Room.* Spread out and work on your school projects, or pick up a craft kit or board game at the Youth Services Desk and get creative!
- *Group Study Rooms.* With a library card or school I.D., students can schedule a block of time in one of our four study rooms.
- *Youth Computer Lab.* In addition to our game computers, mounted iPads, and homework computers, Youth Services also has a computer lab, featuring Internet access and a digital media lab, both supervised by digital literacy specialists and designed specifically for children.
- *Preschool Area.* Here you'll find a LEGO table, puppet stage, toys, computers, and iPads, all customized for toddlers and preschoolers!
- *Baby Garden.* Babies and their caregivers can hang out in this safe corner nook, designed especially for our littlest, non-walking patrons.
- *Junior High Zone.* The name says it all in this dedicated area for older kids. In addition to comfortable seating and open workspaces, the zone also hosts random pop-up programs and video gaming.
- *Come On In!* An ongoing goal of the Youth Services Department is to make the public library a meaningful and popular place for all children. In partnership with  [Niles Township District for Special Education (NTDSE)](http://www.ntdse.org/), Youth Services staff has been trained to better understand and serve children with disabilities. We also offer monthly programs, Sensory Storytime and Rainbow Therapy.
