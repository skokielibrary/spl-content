## Make your reservation

1. Check availability by calling 847-324-3127 or [send an email](tellus@skokielibrary.info).
2. Fill out the [online application](PDF application). 

Or, drop by the Reference Desk and pick up a key.

## Using the space

You can access the Business & Career Center during [regular library hours](/about/hours-location-contact/). It is located on the southwest corner of the second floor of the Library. When you arrive, bring your Skokie Public Library business library card to the Reference Desk and pick up the key to the Center. 

To ensure equal access for everyone, you may be limited to six meetings in a six-month period. 

### Food and drink

Food and drink are allowed, so bring what you need if you plan to serve refreshments. We canâ€™t take delivery of your items for you, so schedule deliveries when you will be present. If you need time to set up before your meeting, allow time for that after the Library opens.

### Set up and clean up

You can set up the space to meet your needs, but please return it to the way you found it when you are finished. When your event is over and the room is restored to its original order, return the key to Reference Desk.  Let us know if you find a mess when you arrive, or if you have a significant spill while you are there.
