##Talking Books discussion group
Those with visual impairments are invited to this monthly discussion of fiction and nonfiction works.

##Homebound delivery
If you have a Skokie Public Library card but can't visit our building because of age, illness, or a temporary or permanent disability, we'll bring the library to you. Call 847-324-3166 to register for our free homebound delivery service. Volunteers and staff will help select and deliver library materials to your door once a month.
