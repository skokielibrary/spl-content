##Upcoming exhibit

###Art Quilts of the Black Threads Collective

“To look at a quilt is to see history,” says Tracy Vaughn-Manley, founder of the Black Threads Collective. She believes that these quilts “represent the resilience of Americans in general and of African American women in particular.”
