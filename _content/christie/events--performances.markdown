We hold a wide variety of performances and cultural events, mostly in our 200-seat auditorium that boasts fine acoustics and good sightlines from every seat.

## Attending performances

When we expect large crowds, free tickets are given out 30 minutes before show time to those people who are in the lobby so that everyone gets a seat without having to be stressed about it. Come and enjoy!

### Bringing children

Some are best for adults, others are intended primarily for families with young children. Some are equally accessible for all ages. We love it when parents take advantage of the opportunities to provide a taste of all types of art without having to spend money on tickets at other venues, with the understanding that parents will not force children to stay once they have reached the limit of their attention span.

## Upcoming Performances

To find out what's coming up, visit our events calendar (can this link go to a filtered view to show only performances?)

Our [Young Steinway Series], now in its 33rd year, features talented young classical musicians.

## Some Recent Performances

(I need to find something we have at least one good photo of--or could this potentially be done as a blog post that gets pulled in here?)
