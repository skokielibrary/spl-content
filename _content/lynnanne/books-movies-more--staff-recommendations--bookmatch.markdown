[BookMatch](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=YFQLLa0b_2fsgA47jViEWyvw_3d_3d) allows Skokie Library cardholders to receive a custom list of titles prepared by the Library's expert readers' advisory staff.

To receive your BookMatch list, fill out this [short survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=YFQLLa0b_2fsgA47jViEWyvw_3d_3d). What are your favorite types of books? Who are the authors you can't stand? What book can you not live without? 

After finishing the survey, expect to receive your custom BookMatch reading list within seven business days.
