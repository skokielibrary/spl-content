Can't find an item in our catalog? We can try to get it from another library or add it to our collection.

##Search LINKin
Your library card gives you access to LINKin, a lending partnership with local libraries. [Search LINKin](http://www.linkin-libraries.org/) or click the "Search Partner Libraries" button in our own catalog and then the "Request this item" link. From there, select Skokie as your home library and enter your card number. We'll let you know when your item is ready to pick up. (Please note that DVDs and new books currently aren't available through LINKin.)

##Not in LINKin?
If you're a Skokie cardholder hunting for a new release, fill out our purchase request form [link] and we'll look into buying it for the library. For items older than six months, submit an interlibrary loan request [link]. 

You can also use your library card to check out items at other suburban public libraries. Try searching the catalogs of the [Morton Grove Public Library](http://mgpl.sirsi.net/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=lKNzLwN0B6/x/48500016/60/1190/X) and nearby libraries (such as Lincolnwood, Niles, Evanston, and Wilmette) that use the [CCS consortium catalog](http://64.107.155.140/cgi-bin/ibistro).
