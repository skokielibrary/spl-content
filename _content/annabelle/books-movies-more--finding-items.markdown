Can't find an item in our catalog? We can try to get it from another library or add it to our collection.

##Search LINKin
Your library card gives you access to LINKin, a lending partnership with local libraries. Here's how it works:
- If you're in our catalog, click "Search Partner Libraries" to get to LINKin.
- You also can search the [LINKin catalog](http://www.linkin-libraries.org/) directly. 
- Found what you're looking for? Click "Request this item." From there, select Skokie as your home library and enter your name and card number. (Please note that DVDs and new books can't be requested via LINKin)
- LINKin items usually arrive in Skokie within 5 days. We'll let you know when they're ready to pick up. 

##Not in LINKin?
If you're a Skokie cardholder hunting for a new release, fill out our purchase request form [link] and we'll look into buying it for the library. For items older than six months, submit an interlibrary loan request [link]. 

You can also use your library card to check out items at other suburban public libraries. Try searching the Morton Grove Public Library [catalog](http://mgpl.sirsi.net/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=lKNzLwN0B6/x/48500016/60/1190/X) or nearby libraries (such as those in Lincolnwood, Niles, Evanston, and Wilmette) that use the joint [CCS catalog](http://64.107.155.140/cgi-bin/ibistro).
