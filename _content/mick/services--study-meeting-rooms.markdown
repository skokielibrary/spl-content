Our building is full of great spaces for studying, meeting, and gathering.

##Study rooms

We have 10 small group study rooms for adults and teens (9th grade and up) on the library's second floor. 
- Reserve a room using the [study room booking system](http://events.skokielibrary.info/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp?mm=1&libnum=2&allroomscheck=1) (you'll need a registered library or computer use card).
- Study rooms can be booked up to a week in advance for as many as 2 hours per card each day.
- Study rooms seat up to 6 people.
 

When the meeting rooms are not needed for Library use, they may be available for community meetings. Click the links below for the meeting room policy, rules and procedures for using meeting rooms, and an application form.

The Business and Career Center is a suite of three rooms that can accommodate up to 49 people. They include a Program Room, a Committee Room, and a Conference Room.
