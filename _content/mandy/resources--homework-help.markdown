Have a tough homework assignment and can't make it to the library? We have several online resources that can help.

##Live Homework Help [link]
Live Homework Help connects students from grade school through junior college in with expert tutors to work on math, science, social studies, and English problems. Tutoring sessions are available from 3 to 10 pm daily and last about 20 minutes. Library cardholders are limited to 5 sessions per week. 

During times when live help isn't available, you can still log in and find worksheets, tutorials, and study guides under the SkillsCenter Resource Library link.
