If you've caught the writing bug and are either hard at work on the Great American Novel or have recently published your masterpiece, we have many ways to help writers enrich their writing and our community. 

##Programs
###Write On!
The Skokie writers group meets monthly at 7 pm on the last Monday of every month. Local aspiring and published authors looking to perfect their skills are invited to gather and workshop their writing. Please bring a writing selection that you would like to workshop. 

###Upcoming Quarterly programs 
(will depend on this quarter's selection)


##How to Be Famous
While we can't make you as well know as James Patterson, we provide many ways in which you can promote and market your masterpiece. 

The library will gladly add self-published books by local authors to our collection. Local authors can donate a bound copy of the book for inclusion in our collection. All donation should be dropped off at the Readers Services Desk. The library will also purchase select books by our local authors. In order for book to be considered for purchasing, the book needs to be available as a print bound book through a major book retailer.
