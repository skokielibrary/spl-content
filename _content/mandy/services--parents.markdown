Our Youth Services Department features books, music, and movies for babies through 8th graders, but that's not all we have to offer. Our circulating collection also includes audiobooks, video games, puppets, Playaway Views, Little Learner backpacks, and STEAM kits.

### What's a STEAM kit?
Skokie cardholders can take home a telescope, digital microscope, model of the human body, or even a steel drum! These Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics kits are great tools for children to explore the world around them while still having fun! We have more than a dozen STEAM kits to choose from--with more coming soon--so visit the Youth Services Desk to see what's available.

### Visiting Youth Services
While you're here, be sure to check out all the fun kid-friendly areas with the department.
- *Program Room.* This is "the place" for many of our storytimes and other programs. We also schedule programs throughout the department, with bigger performances and events happening in the Petty Auditorium or Mary Radmacher Meeting Room. For full details about all of our youth and family programs, visit our Events page. [add link]
- *Craft Room.* Spread out and work on your school projects, or pick up a craft kit or board game at the Youth Services Desk and get creative!
- *Group Study Rooms.* With a library card or school I.D., students can schedule a block of time in one of our four study rooms.
- *Youth Computer Lab.* [TK]
- *Preschool Area.* Here you'll find a LEGO table, puppet stage, toys, computers, and iPads, all customized for toddlers and preschoolers!
- *Baby Garden.* Babies and their caregivers can hang out in this safe corner nook, designed especially for our littlest, non-walking patrons.

### But wait, there's more!
[content about Museum Adventure Pass, Tumblebooks, and other resources, still to come.]

### One last reminder...
*Children under 8 years old must be accompanied by an adult caregiver or parent  at all times throughout the library.*
