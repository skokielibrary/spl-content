##Special needs services for kids
Youth of all abilities are welcome to all library events. If your child has special needs, please call ahead to let us know how we can be most accomodating. The following programs are designed specifically for youth with disabilities.

Rainbow Therapy
Rainbow dog handlers work with children ages 7 to 12 to strengthen motor skills, learn social skills, and increase language use. Parents remain in the library while children attend the program accompanied by trained, volunteer aides. Third Sundays 12:15 to 1:15.

Frindship Club
Kids ages 11 to 16 get to know others their age in a safe, supportive environment with the help of trained peer volunteers.
