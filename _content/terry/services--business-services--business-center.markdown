###Business & Career Center
You can use the [Business & Career Center](link to map of space with room names and occupancy) for working, meeting and making presentions. Skokie Public Library business library card holders can take advantage of our free wi-fi, [business services](Link to business services page), [equipment](link to list of equipment in Business Center and DML) and meeting space. Don't have a business library card? Businesses located in Skokie or members of the Skokie Chamber of Commerce can [apply](http://www.skokielibrary.info/s_about/How/business-card-application.pdf).
