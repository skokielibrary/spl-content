The only thing better than reading a great book is meeting the great mind that produced that book. Many great authors stop by and visit us while they are in town.  


_Some things to include_

Recent author interview

Upcoming author visits

Partnership with Book Stall?

If you are an author interested in presenting at the library, contact the Readers Services librarian Kathy Sexton ksexton@skokielibrary.info.
