##Library Cards
###Skokie Residents - Visit the west checkout desk to apply for a library card. Present photo I.D. with your name and current Skokie address to get started. Children under the age of 16 need a parent's signature. Young children need to be able to print their first and last name. You may also start the process online [online card application]()
###Non-Skokie Residents - Customers who hold a valid library card from one of the RAILS member public libraries may bring their library card and photo I.D. with name and current address to the west checkout desk and have it registered. Most items may be checked out, however borrowing limits will apply. Customers outside of the RAILS system may purchase a Skokie Public Library card for the cost of taxpayer support.
###Skokie Businesses - Companies based in Skokie or those with a current membership in the Skokie Chamber of Commerce may apply for a business library card. Complete the business library card application form and return to Skokie Public Library with the required documentation. Cards will be mailed to the business address.[business card application form]()
###Lost Library Cards - Call immediately to report a lost or stolen card. You are responsible for any items checked out with the card until you notify the library. Replacement cards cost $1.00.
