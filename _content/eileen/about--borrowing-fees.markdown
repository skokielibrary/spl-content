###Renewals
You can renew most items at least once if no one else is on the waiting list. Call 847-673-2675 to use our automated renewal line or log in to renew online.

###Reserves and pickup
You can have up to 15 items on reserve at any one time. Place reserves through our catalog, in person, or by phone. If you don't see something you want, request it [link to request page]. 

Pick up reserved items at the library or elect to have them placed on the Bookmobile [link to page] or delivered to you through the mail with Library Express (mailing cost is $2 per item).

###Due date notification
We'll email due date, overdue, and reserve notifications if you wish. Give us your email address when you get your library card or add an email to your account (log in and select "Edit account").

###Paying fines 
You can pay fines using cash or check at the East or West Checkout Desks. To pay with a credit or debit card, use one of our self-checkout machine or pay online. For online payment, log in to your account, select "Fines/Fees" and then "Pay Online."

###Change of address
If you move, update your address and phone number at the West Checkout Desk.
