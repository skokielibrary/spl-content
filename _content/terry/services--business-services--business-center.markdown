###Business & Career Center
You can use the [Business & Career Center](link to map of space with room names and occupancy) for working, meeting and presenting. Skokie Public Library business library card holders can take advantage of our free wi-fi, [business services](Link to business services page), [equipment](link to list of equipment in Business Center and DML) and meeting space.
