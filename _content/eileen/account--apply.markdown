Your library card connects you to a wealth of resources, learning, and enrichment. You can register for a card at our West Checkout Desk on the first floor. If you have questions about library cards or your account, email [link] Customer Services or call 847-673-7774.

##How do I get a card?

###Skokie residents
Bring a photo I.D. with your name and current Skokie address to the West Checkout Desk to apply. Residents under the age of 16 need a parent's signature; young children need to be able to print their first and last name to get their own card. You may also start the process online [link] and later pick up your card in person (don't forget to bring I.D.).

###Suburban residents
If you don't live in Skokie but have a library card from RAILS member public library [link to RAILS], bring your card and photo I.D. with name and current address to register your card at Skokie. Nonresidents can check out most of our items, but some borrowing limits [link] do apply. If you live in Chicago or elsewhere outside the RAILS system, you can buy a Skokie Public Library card for the cost of taxpayer support.

###Skokie businesses
Companies based in Skokie or members of the Skokie Chamber of Commerce can apply for a business library card. Complete the business library card application form [link] and return to Skokie Public Library with the required documentation. [need to find out what this is]. We'll mail the card to the business address.

##Lost Library Cards
Call immediately to report a lost or stolen card, as you're responsible for any items checked out with the card until you notify the library. Replacement cards cost $1.
