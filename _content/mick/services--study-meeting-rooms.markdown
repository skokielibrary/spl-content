Our building is full of great spaces for studying and holding business meetings and community gatherings.

##Study rooms

We have 10 small group study rooms for adults and teens on the library's second floor. You can reserve a room up to a week in advance using the [study room booking system](http://events.skokielibrary.info/evanced/lib/roomrequest.asp?mm=1&libnum=2&allroomscheck=1) (you'll need a registered library or computer use card for reservations). Rooms can be booked for up to 2 hours each day per card per day. 

When the meeting rooms are not needed for Library use, they may be available for community meetings. Click the links below for the meeting room policy, rules and procedures for using meeting rooms, and an application form.

The Business and Career Center is a suite of three rooms that can accommodate up to 49 people. They include a Program Room, a Committee Room, and a Conference Room.
