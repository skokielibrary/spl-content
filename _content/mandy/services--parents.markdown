Our Youth Services Department features books, music, and movies for babies through 8th graders, but that's not all we have to offer. 

Our circulating collection also includes audiobooks, video games, puppets, Playaway Views, Little Learner backpacks, and STEAM kits.

##Visiting Youth Services

While you're here, be sure to check out all the kid-friendly areas within the department.
- *Program Room.* "The place" for many of our storytimes and other programs. We also host programs throughout the department, with bigger performances and events scheduled in the Petty Auditorium or Mary Radmacher Meeting Room. For full details about all of our youth and family programs, visit our [Events](http://skokielibrary.info/s_programs/index.asp) page. 
- *Craft Room.* Pick up a craft kit or board game at the Youth Services Desk and get ready for fun!
- *Group Study Rooms.* With a library card or school I.D., students can schedule a block of time in one of our four study rooms.
- *Youth Computer Lab.* In addition to our game computers, mounted iPads, and homework computers, the Youth Computer Lab features Internet access and a digital media lab, supervised by digital literacy specialists and designed specifically for children.
- *Preschool Area.* You'll find a LEGO table, puppet stage, toys, computers, and iPads, all customized for toddlers and preschoolers!
- *Baby Garden.* Babies and their caregivers can hang out in this safe corner nook, designed especially for our littlest, non-walking patrons.
- *Junior High Zone.* The name says it all in this dedicated area for older kids. With comfortable seating and open workspaces, the zone also hosts random pop-up programs and video gaming.

##Family resources and activities

###Programs
We offer many lively storytimes and interactive programs for families. For full details about all of our youth and family programs, visit our [Events](http://skokielibrary.info/s_programs/index.asp) page. 

[This is redundant and the second sentence is an exact repeat from the Program Room blurb above. It is better suited here and programming needed their own callout.]

###Museum Adventure Pass

We participate in the [Museum Adventure Pass](http://www.museumadventure.org/) program. Use your Skokie Public Library card to get discounts and passes to more than a dozen participating destinations.

###Come On In!

An ongoing goal is to make the library a meaningful and popular place for all children. In partnership with  [Niles Township District for Special Education (NTDSE)](http://www.ntdse.org/), Youth Services staff has been trained to better understand and serve children with disabilities. We also offer monthly programs, including Sensory Storytime and Rainbow Therapy.

###Voice of Youth Award (VOYA)
